Lessons from having a complex vim config: don't do it
=====================================================

It's a time sink. 

Having the vim configuration break all the time, and pasting in "nice to have"
stuff has caused me more disruption / harm than it has benefitted me. I'm trying
to turn my VIM into a lean editing system, and just learning plain-old VIM more
effectively.

If you want to go back to where I used to be to look feel free to see:

I'm hoping to have a happier, healthier VIM experience, life, etc.
with a simple vim config.
